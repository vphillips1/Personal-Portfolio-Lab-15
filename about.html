   <p> I am currently trying to pursue my career in computer technology. I always was fascinated with engineering. I took a few mechanical engineering courses in college and ever since then, I wanted to go into engineering.
       I took a few workshops in computer programming and that is when I realize that it would be something that I would definitely want to look into. I took a few front end workshops at Grand Circus and also I took a backend workshop at Quicken Loans and that is when I was introduced to C# .Net. 
       Now I am currently a student at Grand Circus learning about C#.Net in depth.
       I am passionate about software engineering and I want to continue with this career path.
