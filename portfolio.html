             <p>I have completed a few projects and submitted them to github. Please visit my github link to review all the individual projects and the group projects I have completed. My favorite individual lab I completed was the Blockbuster one. I really enjoy watching movies, so the movie lab was one of my favorite. I also liked the midterm project as well. Our group decided to do the point of sales transaction. 
              We created a store and we had the user to choose from the selected items in the store. The midterm was very enjoyable as well, because I was able to learn from other classmates. I love the experience with working with other people because I learn so much from them. Also, I am building my connections. </p>
      
            <p>Here are a few more projects that I would like to highlight. I thought the ATM lab was a challenge, but I understood how to do methods much more. Please see link below. </p>

            <p> Getting to know your classmates is the other project I would like you to review. I had to be very creative. I had plenty of fun completing this project as well. Please click on link below.</p>
