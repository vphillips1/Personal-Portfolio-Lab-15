                    <p>What would I love to learn how to do ? </p>
                    <p>There are so many different things out here I would be interested in learning. I honestly would love to learn how to play the guitar. The guitar has always been one of the top 3 instruments I always wanted to learn.
                         When I have the time, I am going to learn how to play the guitar one day. 
                        I currently play basic piano and I enjoy every second of it. I need to learn how to play more songs, so I can sing and play along. </p>

                        <p>Another thing I would love to learn is learn how to paint very well. I've seen alot of artists whose paintings are very beautiful and mind blowing. I know it will take alot to learn and some individuals are just gifted.</p>
                        <p> What I love to cook!</p>
                        <P> I love to cook different types of food. My favorite food is sea food and mexican. I love to cook turkey loaded nachos and burrito bowls. I enjoy cooking when I have the time. I try to come up with different ideas and try to make new dishes. Seafood is my specialty. I love to grill crab legs and bake alot of my seafood. For example, I love to cook baked fish. </P>
